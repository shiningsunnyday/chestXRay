    "This tutorial demonstrates how to use the *cross-modal data programming* technique described in Dunnmon and Ratner, et al. (2019) to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for chest radiograph triage with no hand-labeled training data that performs similarly to a CNN supervised using several thousand data points labeled by radiologists. \n",
    "\n",
    "In cross-modal data programming, we model and combine expert-provided heuristics written over an auxiliary modality (e.g. a text report), which is only available at training time, to create probabilistic labels for training a machine learning model over a target modality (e.g. a chest radiograph).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we provide a step-by-step walkthrough of how to apply this technique to a small, publicly available chest radiograph dataset.  This process is equivalent to that followed for each dataset in our 2019 submission. \n",

    "We use high-level APIs from the [Snorkel MeTaL](https://github.com/HazyResearch/metal) software package (imported as `metal`) to support heuristic development and model training.
